# Basel-III-IV-Capital-Requirement-Calculator
 Project Objective
 To build a Basel III/IV Capital Requirement Calculator that computes Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), and identifies capital shortfalls/surpluses.The project simulates exposure data, applies risk weights, and generates compliance reportsaligned with regulatory standards
Why Important:
Basel III/IV capital adequacy norms are a global regulatory standard for banks and financial institutions.
This project demonstrates regulatory knowledge & practical calculation skills, crucial for roles in Risk Management, Credit Risk, and Banking Advisory.
 Methodology
 1. Load asset exposure data including asset class, exposure amount, risk weight, and capital
 components.
 2. Calculate RWA for each exposure: RWA = Exposure × Risk Weight.
 3. Sum RWAs across all exposures to determine total RWA.
 4. Compute Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital from provided data.
 5. Calculate CAR: CAR = (Tier 1 + Tier 2) / Total RWA × 100.
 6. Compare CAR against Basel III/IV minimum requirement (10.5%) to detect shortfall/surplus.
 7. Generate detailed report summarizing RWA, capital composition, CAR, and compliance status.
 8. Visualize capital structure and CAR trends for better understanding

Basel III/IV Capital Requirement Calculator
 Total RWA: 6,200,000
 Tier 1 Capital: 900,000
 Tier 2 Capital: 200,000
 CAR: 17.74%
 Capital Adequacy: Met 

 Conclusion
 This project demonstrates practical Basel III/IV capital adequacy computations, enabling financial institutions to evaluate regulatory compliance. By calculating RWAs, capital components, and CAR, banks can proactively manage capital buffers and meet supervisory requirements. Visualization tools further aid in communicating compliance status to stakeholders
